Once Upon A Party came along to the Spalding Grammar School Fete last Saturday. What a fab time all the children had! We had Princess meet'n'greet and photographs followed by a sing-along performance in which the children could sing and dance along to all their favourite tunes. Fab time had by all!
Thank you Once Upon A Party!

My two granddaughters were thrilled when their favourite Princess dropped by and made jewellery boxes with them before retiring to the garden for a dance and singalong to their favourite songs . Excellent value!
